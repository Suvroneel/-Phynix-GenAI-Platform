# Phynix Ai

> *The more you talk to it, the more it becomes YOURS.*

Most AI talks at you. Phynix grows with you. It remembers how you felt last session, notices your patterns over time, and meets you where you actually are instead of starting from zero every single time.


**🔗 Live Demo:** https://phynix.streamlit.app/

Phynix is an **end-to-end mood-aware GenAI platform** designed to give users a personalised AI experience that genuinely evolves with them. The heart of the system is **Ashva**, an intelligent companion powered by **BERT for emotion detection** and **Llama 3.1** for empathetic, context-aware conversations.

This platform is **multi-page**, **multi-layered**, and production-ready, combining a sophisticated frontend, hybrid AI/NLP backend, and relational database analytics.

## 🆕 Recent Updates

### v2.2 - RAG Memory Engine + pgvector - April 2026
Ashva now actually remembers you. Not just your last emotion, but real context from both your past conversations and diary entries. Built a unified RAG pipeline using pgvector on Supabase PostgreSQL with sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic embeddings. Every chat message and diary entry gets embedded and stored in a vector store. When you return, Ashva retrieves the most semantically relevant memories across both sources and uses them to generate a genuinely personal welcome, powered by the LLM. The more you talk and write, the more Ashva actually knows you. Falls back to emotion-based greeting if no embeddings exist yet, and a generic welcome for brand new users. This is what "the more you talk to it, the more it becomes YOURS" actually means under the hood.

### v2.1.1 - Ashva Diaries (Mood Journal) - March 2026
Replaced the static placeholder with a fully functional journaling feature. Users can write daily reflections, optionally attach an image, and view today's entries as timestamped cards. Entries are stored in Supabase PostgreSQL with images in a dedicated Supabase Storage bucket. Fresh slate every day at midnight IST. Built with privacy-first design, no mood tagging, no sentiment analysis, just open reflection.

### v2.0 - GenAI Backend - February 2026
Replaced static hard-coded responses with a live GenAI backend. Ashva now generates dynamic, context-aware empathetic responses using Llama 3.1 (8B-Instruct) via Hugging Face Inference API.

## AI & NLP Layer

### Emotion Classification (BERT)
- **Fine-tuned BERT model** for emotion detection
- Classifies user messages into **seven emotion categories**:
  - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral
- Provides **confidence scores** for each prediction
- **Risk level assessment** based on detected emotions and sentiment intensity
- Real-time inference with sub-second response times

### Generative AI Response System
Phynix uses **Llama 3.1 (8B-Instruct)** via the **Hugging Face Inference API** for all AI-generated responses.

- **Fast, general-purpose conversational AI**
- **Excellent instruction-following capabilities**
- **Strong context understanding across multi-turn conversations**
- **Emotion-aware prompting** -- responses are tailored to the user's detected emotional state

### AI Integration Features
- **Context-aware responses** -- full conversation history maintained for coherent dialogue
- **Temperature control** -- adjustable creativity from factual (0.0) to creative (1.0)
- **Token length management** -- configurable response lengths
- **Emotion-based prompting** -- AI responses tailored to detected emotional state
- **Fallback handling** -- graceful error management with user-friendly messages

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Model used for all AI responses
model = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"

# Inference pipeline
1. User message -> BERT emotion detection
2. Emotion label + conversation history -> Llama 3.1
3. AI generates empathetic, context-aware response
4. Response stored with metadata (emotion, risk, confidence)
```
